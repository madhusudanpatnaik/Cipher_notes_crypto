# CYPHER NOTES USING FERNET SYMMETRIC KEY ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM



<h1>ABSTRACT</h1>
</br>
Now-a-days data is very valuable, data protection is been very important because our life will be entirely
changed if our data is known to an unauthorized person, so to make sure of enough confidentiality for the
data we have several protocols during transmission of the data in an unsecure channel, but when any
individual is dealing with a confidential data in any workplace or any public places there are very high
chances for the other persons to know the data that is private to a particular individual. To overcome this
problem we have come up with a solution where the data will be well hidden from the unauthorized persons
while reading or writing the data. In our proposed approach, we are using OpenCV for verifying the
registered user and Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm for encrypting the data and tkinker for GUI.
